Deadwood is a recursive DNS program that is supported for two platforms:
Windows XP (via MinGW) and CentOS Linux version 5.  This program may or 
may not work on other platforms, but will not be supported on any other 
platform without some kind of support deal made (but see "Other platforms"
below).

Note that while I do not fully support Deadwood on Windows Vista/7, there 
is a supplied document (doc\Windows\Vista.txt) that describes one way
to get Deadwood to run in Vista and Windows 7.

The rest of this document deals with how to compile this code in CentOS 5,
followed by a section on how to compile this code in Windows XP.

==CENTOS 5==

To compile this program in CentOS 5, first set the environmental variable 
FLAGS to the flags you wish to give the compiler.  For example, with gcc,
you probably want to make the compile-time flags "-O3" unless you
are making this as small as possible for an embedded system.

To set tha flags to be "-O3" using a POSIX-compliant shell (Bash, ash, etc.):

	export FLAGS='-O3'

Once the compile-time flags are set, the next step is to compile the
program.  If in CentOS 5, enter the src directory and use 'make' to do this:

	cd src/
	make -f Makefile.centos5

There is a single program compiled, Deadwood.  Place this program where
it can be used.  For example, to place this program in the directory
/usr/local/bin, as root:

	cp Deadwood /usr/local/bin
	cd /usr/local/bin

Return back to the directory with this file. 

The next step is to install the man page for Deadwood.  
Here is one way to do this as root:

	cd doc/
	cp Deadwood.1 /usr/local/share/man/man1

Of course, you may want to start up this program and run it as a 
daemon when the system starts up.  First, look at the text file
dwood2rc (in the doc/ directory) and edit it.  Then, make
this file /etc/dwood3rc.  For example:

	nano -w dwood3rc
	cp dwood3rc /etc

You will also want to make a directory for Deadwood.  This is the
chroot_dir parameter in the dwood2rc file, and by default points to
/etc/deadwood:

	mkdir /etc/deadwood
	chown 99:99 /etc/deadwood
	
Deadwood doesn't have any daemonization capability; this is handled
by a separate program I wrote for MaraDNS, 'duende'.  This program
is in the tools/ directory, and needs to be compiled separately
from Deadwood.  

	cd tools/
	make
	cp duende /usr/local/bin
	mkdir /etc/maradns
	mkdir /etc/maradns/logger

The directory /etc/maradns/logger is needed for duende to run.

Now, you will want to edit your system start-up scripts to start
up Deadwood.  To do this in CentOS 5, make a file with the name 
/etc/init.d/deadwood with the following content:

#!/bin/sh
case "$1" in
  start)
        /usr/local/bin/duende /usr/local/bin/Deadwood
        ;;
  stop)
        killall Deadwood
        ;;
esac
# End of startup script

Make sure /etc/init.d/deadwood can be run as a program:
	
	chmod 755 /etc/init.d/deadwood

Then, you will want to have this script be run at system boot time:

	cd /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/
	ln -s ../init.d/deadwood S61deadwood
	cd /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/
	ln -s ../init.d/deadwood S61deadwood

Note that system startup is variable between distributions and the above
steps may not work if you're not using CentOS 5.  If you wish help with 
using Deadwood with another version of Linux or *NIX, send me an email
and we'll discuss rates.  Or send an email to the MaraDNS list and someone
(possibly me) may or may not help you.

It is possible to compile Deadwood with IPv6 support, or with caching
disabled (which makes the binary a little smaller, for really tiny
embedded systems).  See the file doc/compile.options for details

==WINDOWS XP==

The simplest way to run this program in Windows XP is to use the prebuilt
binary (.exe file) which should be in the same place as the place where 
you obtained this source code, with a name like 
"Deadwood-2-X-XX-win32.zip" (or "Deadwood-2-X-XX-win32.7z").

The simplest way to compile this program in Windows XP is to use the
version of Deadwood bundled with the Tiny C Compiler and a batch file
called "tcc-compile.bat" which compiles Deadwood; this has a filename
like "deadwood-tcc-2.X.XX.7z", but needs the 7-zip program 
(http://7.zip.org) or another program that can understand .7z files such
as WinRAR in order to decompress.

The way I compile this program in Windows XP is with MinGW-3.4.2 and
MSYS-1.0.10.  These programs are available at the following locations:

	ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/misc/ (MinGW 3.4.2)
	http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.10.exe?download
	http://samiam.org/software (both)

Once MinGW is set up, to compile the Deadwood service, enter the "src/"
directory and run the following commands:

	export FLAGS=-O3
	make -f Makefile.mingw342

Once this is done, there will be a file called Deadwood.exe, which is
a Windows service.  First, find a suitable directory on your file system
to install Deadwood, such as "c:\Program Files\Deadwood\"

Once Deadwood.exe is placed in this directory, install the service:

	Deadwood --install

Before you can run the service, you will need a file named "dwood2rc.txt"
for Deadwood to read its parameters from in the same directory Deadwood.exe
was placed.  An example file is in doc\Windows\dwood2rc.txt

You need to make a file with random text in it called secret.txt.

Once these two files are in place, and properly configured, Deadwood
can be started:

	net start Deadwood

(You can also start it from Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services)

Deadwood, at this point, should automatically start whenever the system is 
booted.

Deadwood uses a file to store messages called "dwlog.txt" (without the quotes)
in the same directory where Deadwood is started.  If there are any errors
that make it so Deadwood can not start, they should be noted in this log
file.  

To stop Deadwood:

	net stop Deadwood

(Or from the Services control panel if you prefer mousing it)

Deadwood will write its cache to a file (if specified) when stopped as a
service.

Deadwood service provides DNS-over-UDP and DNS-over-TCP support; note
that DNS packets too long to fit in a 512-byte UDP packet are not cached.

It should be possible to remove the Deadwood service:

	Deadwood --remove 

If one wishes to uninstall Deadwood.

==OTHER PLATFORMS==

Just because Deadwood is only fully supported in CentOS 5 and Windows XP
doesn't mean Deadwood doesn't run on other platforms.  It just means that,
if you wish to run Deadwood on another platform, it's up to you to make
the port.  Or, if you prefer, pay me to make the port for you.  

I have made the code portable; there should not be any endian issues (this
has not been tested since I don't have access to a big-endian computer) nor 
non-standard libraries needed to compile this; I ensure Deadwood compiles 
with no warnings when compiled with -Wall in GCC 3, GCC 4.3, and GCC 4.4.  

Note that Deadwood uses stdint.h, which some non-standards-compilant 
proprietary compilers (Microsoft, *cough* *cough*) may not have.  If you wish 
to compile Deadwood with one of these compilers, please find a version of 
stdint.h for your compiler; I know there is a pstdint.h out there that 
works with most Microsoft and Borland compilers.

The CentOS 5 Makefile should work on other Linux variants, as well as other 
*NIX clones, but no guarantees.  For example, there is a Cygwin Makefile 
included in the "src/" directory; I have verified that Deadwood 2.4 compiles 
in Cygwin without problem.  This may make it possible to have a version of 
Deadwood in Windows with IPv6 support; Cygwin 1.7 and later should have 
IPv6 and it might be possible to compile in IPv6 this way.  Again, if this 
is something you're interested in, feel free to send patches to the MaraDNS 
mailing list, or offer to pay me.

==SUPPORT==

The channels of support for Deadwood are the same as for MaraDNS: Post it
to the MaraDNS mailing list or pay me for support via email.  Details are
at http://www.maradns.org/

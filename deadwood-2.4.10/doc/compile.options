There are a number of different possible compile-time options for
Deadwood.  It can be compiled as follows:

* CentOS 5, no IPV6

* CentOS 5, IPV6

* Windows XP, no IPV6

The default compile gives no IPv6

To compile Deadwood with IPv6 support, add '-DIPV6' to the compile-time
flags.  

The reason why one may wish IPv6 is to use Deadwood on an IPv6 network.

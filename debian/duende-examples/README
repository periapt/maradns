This example is to show how one could use duende in building 
a daemonized service.
1.) Install the following packages:
    libanyevent-perl
    libio-async-perl
    libdatetime-perl
    libreadonly-perl

2.) Set up executable and init script
    sudo ln -s /usr/share/doc/duende/examples/example.pl /usr/sbin/example
    sudo ln -s /usr/share/doc/duende/examples/example.init /etc/init.d/example

3.) You can now start the example script as you would any other daemon service.
It does the following:
-   Every 61 seconds it will log a heartbeat message.
-   It will complain to syslog if it receives a USR1 or USR2 signal.
-   It listens on localhost:8888 and will log any connection attempt.

Comment: The public domain files in the source generally include small
 utilities, such as the code for NanoDNS which is copied multiple times
 across the documentation. Anyone wishing to use the public domain status
 of a given file should check carefully for themselves the status of a given
 file. They would however be safe in using it under the main package copyright
 and license. Notice also that some files such as those in rng/*, are in the
 public domain but have been copyrighted, licensed and modified by the upstream
 author.

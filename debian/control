Description: simple security-focused Domain Name Service server
 An easy to configure DNS server that functions as a
 recursive and/or authoritative name server. Maradns is
 optimised for serving a small number of domains quickly and
 efficiently. Well suited to host your own private DNS server
 for making up subdomains with minimal fuss. Maradns is
 security-aware by utilising a special string library which
 is resistant to buffer overflows and mandating to run as an
 unprivileged user.

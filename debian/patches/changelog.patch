+   maradns-1.4.06
+
+    * Fix for packet of death security issue
+
+    "In 2002, when I rewrote the compression code for MaraDNS for the first
+    time, I made a mistake in allocating an array of integers, allocating
+    it in bytes instead of sizeof(int) units.  The resulted in a buffer
+    being too small, allowing it to be overwritten.
+
+    The impact of this programming error is that MaraDNS can be crashed by
+    sending MaraDNS a single "packet of death".  Since the data placed in
+    the overwritten array can not be remotely controlled (it is a list of
+    increasing integers), there is no way to increase privileges
+    exploiting this bug.
+
+    The attached patch resolves this issue by allocating in sizeof(int)
+    units instead of byte-sized units for an integer array.  In addition,
+    it uses a smaller array because a DNS name can only have, at most, 128
+    labels."

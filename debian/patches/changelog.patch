                           MaraDNS changelog
+    maradns-1.4.09:
+
+     Hotfix: The hash randomization now has 31 bits of entropy, and the
+     hash does a fairly good job of choosing a random hash bucket again.
+
+     (2011.12.30)
+
+    maradns-1.4.08:
+
+     Security hotfix: Hash randomization added to MaraDNS 1's recursive
+     resolver. MaraDNS 2 is not impacted (it's been using a randomized
+     hash since 2007).
+
+     (2011.12.29)

+       * AngelD's issue with zone transfers when there are a lot of
+         FQDN4 records fixed.
+       * Karim's issue with '/read' directive fixed
+
+     (2011.11.11)
